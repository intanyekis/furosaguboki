However, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Jennifer Aniston revealed that filming this reunion was one of the hardest things</a> she’s ever done. In an interview for The Hollywood Reporter, the actress admitted that she originally thought that making a reunion would be fun, but she was wrong. It ended up being so emotionally challenging she had to walk off the set on several occasions.</p><p>"I think we were just so naive walking into it, thinking, 'How fun is this going to be? They're putting the sets back together, exactly as they were,'" <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Aniston said of the making of Friends: The Reunion</a>.

You thought everything was in front of you and life was going to be just gorgeous and then you went through maybe the hardest time in your life?'"</p><p>The actress further explained that there were times when it became too much and she needed to take a breather, "It was all very jarring and, of course, you've got cameras everywhere and I’m already a little emotionally accessible, I guess you could say, so I had to walk out at certain points. I don't know how they cut around it."</p><p>Despite how emotionally draining it was, Aniston managed to finish filming the reunion, which ultimately was a huge hit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=despite-walking-off-the-set-jennifer-aniston-claims-that-filming-the-friends-reunion-was-a-blessing>Despite Walking Off The Set, Jennifer Aniston Claims That Filming The Friends Reunion Was A Blessing</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2-16.jpg><p>Jennifer Aniston admitted that filming Friends: The Reunion was extremely hard. Being back on the set of Friends brought back a lot of painful memories for the actress. It was also a reminder of how much things have changed for her. In an interview for Rob Lowe's podcast, Literally! With Rob Lowe, Aniston explained that the whole experience was “melancholic.”</p><p>"Going back there, it's nostalgic in a way that's kind of also a little melancholy, you know," she explained. "Because a lot has changed and we have all gone down different roads, not so easy and some easy ... for each of us." Despite this, the former Friends star called the experience a "blessing" nonetheless.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Jennifer Aniston And Matt LeBlanc Agreed With Matthew Perry's Dark Thoughts About Fame During Their Larry King Interview</a></span></p><p>"But again, everything's a blessing if you're able to look at life's ups and downs in that way," Aniston told The Hollywood Reporter.

"The dental surgery just made my mouth feel like fire and it sounded like my voice was off. And I couldn’t show up.
