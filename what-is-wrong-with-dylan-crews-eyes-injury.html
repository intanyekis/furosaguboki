Gavin Turley of Oregon State ultimately connected on the play with an inside-the-park home run.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>But it didn’t matter since LSU managed to hold on and move on to a super regional. Crews should be alright, despite his soreness, as the Tigers will meet the winner of Indiana and Kentucky the following weekend.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“I’m going to take some time off to clear my head. On the other hand, I’ll be watching Indiana and Kentucky. I am anticipating it. … I’m hurting right now, so I need an ice bath,” Crews said.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>We hope he will recover quickly from his injuries and soon be able to play again.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Dylan Crews Wiki And Age Details</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Talented American baseball outfielder Dylan Gray Crews now competes for Louisiana State University’s athletic team, the LSU Tigers.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He was born on February 26, 2002, and spent much of his childhood in Central Florida, where he first fell in love with baseball.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Crews spent four years on the baseball varsity team at Lake Mary High School.
