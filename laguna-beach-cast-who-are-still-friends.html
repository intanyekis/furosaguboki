Laguna Beach was the show to watch; living by the beach, throwing bonfires, and rocking Hollister fit suddenly seemed like the most incredible dream for high schoolers. The show aired on MTV, and though loved at the time, <a href=#>some aspects of Laguna Beach have not aged well</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The show held viewers spellbound for three seasons before moving on to its first spinoff, The Hills, which focused on the life of Lauren Conrad as she navigated a career in fashion. While some original <a href=#>cast of Laguna Beach</a> continued in the spinoff series, others pursued a path outside of reality TV. Growing up into adulthood and following different paths brought a divide among the cast members who were once friends. These Laguna Beach cast are still friends almost two decades after the show aired.</p><p><strong>Updated on January 16th, 2023 by Abigail Thomas: </strong>Laguna Beach was one of the most popular television shows in the early 2000s. It was one of the first reality shows of its kind, following the lives of Southern Californians as they tackled relationships and growing up. Almost two decades later, the cast have moved on to other projects, but they still remember how they got their start in the industry. A reunion occurred in 2019 when The Hills: New Beginnings aired for two seasons. Kristin Cavallari and Stephen Colletti began hosting a rewatch of Laguna Beach in 2022, and they have brought in many former cast members to discuss the show and their lives after it ended.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What We've Learned From The Laguna Beach Rewatch Podcast</a></span></p><h2 id=morgan-olsen-and-christina-schuller><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Morgan Olsen And Christina Schuller</span></h2><p>Morgan Olsen, now Morgan Smith, and Christina Schuller, now Christina Sinclair, were only on the show's premiere season. Morgan and Christina were part of Conrad's group of friends, but the BFFs were closer to each other than anyone else. To date, the onscreen besties are still friends. Christina did not only attend her friend's wedding; she was a bride's maid when Morgan got married to her beau, Joel Smith. In December 2019, the Minnow swimwear founder shared a picture of them having a great time at her baby shower.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lauren-conrad-and-lo-bosworth><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Lauren Conrad And Lo Bosworth</span></h2><p>Lauren was the lead star of the first season of Laguna Beach and her spinoff series, The Hills. As the show's protagonist, Lauren had her biggest enemies and best friends on the show. Of the fashion entrepreneur's BFFs, <a href=#>Lo Bosworth was arguably her closest</a>; the two shared a special bond from being childhood friends. The friendship between Lauren and Lo is still solid years after the show; in response to a comment on a TikTok video, Bosworth reaffirmed that she and Lauren are still friends.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Was Laguna Beach Real Or Fake?</a></span></p><h2 id=lauren-conrad-and-whitney-port><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Lauren Conrad And Whitney Port</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Port went from being star-struck on the first day she met Conrad to becoming close friends with her on Laguna Beach's spinoff, The Hills. Then, the young adults shared a mutual interest in fashion, forming the basis of their friendship. Conrad and Port worked as part-time interns for Teen Vogue and People's Revolution. In 2020, The Hills alums <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reunited and had a candid chat</a> about their friendship and the show in general.</p><h2 id=kristin-cavallari-and-alex-hooser><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Kristin Cavallari And Alex Hooser</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kristin, Alex H, and Jessica were best friends on the show. Kristin and Alex were so close that they lived together for a short period. Although living together brought some strain to their jolly relationship, the onscreen BFFs found a way around it. In a chat with BuzzFeed, the reality tv star disclosed that she was in constant communication with Alex H. Unfortunately, the friendship between Kristin and her other BFF, Jessica, withered away after the show.</p><h2 id=lauren-conrad-and-stephen-colletti><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Lauren Conrad And Stephen Colletti</span></h2><p>Lauren and Stephen had an on-and-off relationship that ultimately left her heart broken. Fans were particularly excited about the reconciliation between Lauren and Stephen; the now friendly exes have kept in touch. In 2018, the One Tree Hill alum told US about his ex; he said, "Conrad and I, we're usually down there around the 4th of July, and she'll host people. She does a great job hosting, shocker!" Lauren was also a guest on Stephen's podcast with Kristin Cavallari in November 2022 to discuss Laguna Beach and their lives today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Did Laguna Beach Ruin Kristin Cavallari And Lauren Conrad's One-Time Friendship?</a></span></p><h2 id=dieter-schmitz-and-stephen-colletti><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Dieter Schmitz And Stephen Colletti</span></h2><p>Dieter Schmitz appeared in two seasons of Laguna Beach, and in both seasons, he was mostly referred to as Stephen's friend. Dieter was generally a nice guy on the show, but he shared a unique friendship with Conrad and Stephen. In 2016, when Dieter exchanged vows with his missus, his wedding was a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">mini-reunion for the Laguna Beach cast</a>. One of the main highlights of the wedding was Stephen performing groomsmen duties for his long-time friend.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=brody-jenner-and-frankie-delgado><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Brody Jenner And Frankie Delgado</span></h2><p>The Hills co-stars Brody and Frankie have a bromance spanned over a decade.

Despite putting up a brave face, Brody was emotionally wrecked when his marriage to Katilyn Carter ended, but Frankie walked with him through the tough time. In an interview with HL, the restaurateur revealed that Brody is now in a good place emotionally.</p><h2 id=brody-jenner-and-speidi-spencer-pratt-and-heidi-montag><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Brody Jenner And Speidi (Spencer Pratt And Heidi Montag)</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brody and Kristin are primarily responsible for the birth of Speidi, as the co-stars introduced Spencer to Heidi. Brody remained intimate friends with the couple, so much that he offered to pay for an IVF during their pregnancy struggles. So when the couple scaled through their trying phase, Brody was the only The Hills co-star that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">knew about the pregnancy</a>. According to Spencer, Brody is a good friend of his family; The Hills alum was invested in their pregnancy journey and was the most excited person at the news of their pregnancy.</p><h2 id=kristin-cavallari-and-stephen-colletti><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Kristin Cavallari And Stephen Colletti</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2022, Kristin Cavallari and Stephen Colletti <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">began creating a podcast together</a>.
