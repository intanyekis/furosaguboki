I was there'" according to People.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though there are still some challenges in Andrei and Elizabeth's relationship, they seem like they want to stick together and get through it.
