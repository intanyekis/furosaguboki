"Whenever I do business, it's not about the money."</p><p>We’ll delve into that statement even further throughout the article, taking a look at Shaq’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">spending habits.</a> He isn’t afraid to spend on others, we’ll see all those generous acts throughout the list, whether it was buying someone a home, or picking up the bill on someone’s laptop at Best Buy.</p><p>We’ll also look at other things he loves to purchase, such as cars, bicycles, and motorcycles, his garage is a dream and a lot of his rides are totally customized to fit his needs. Enjoy folks as we take a look at everything&nbsp;the former <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NBA</a> legend&nbsp;spends his money on. Let’s get started!</p><h2 id=special-sweet-16-gift><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Special Sweet 16 Gift</span></h2><p>Athletes have a different way of spoiling their children and that’s especially true for Shaq, who isn’t afraid to open his wallet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For most of us, we can’t even remember what we got for our sweet 16… as for Shaq’s son, he’ll definitely remember forever, given that he wasn’t granted one car, but two! Shaq bought his son a stunning Jeep and as if that wasn’t enough, it came with a sleek dream car for a lot of us, a Lamborghini. Both rides cost the big man in the six-figure range. Not to mention the massive party he threw for his son. It was a costly night for Shaq.</p><h2 id=home-for-paralyzed-12-year-old><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Home For Paralyzed 12-Year-Old</span></h2><p>Shaq was deeply touched by this story, as a 12-year-old was left paralyzed due to gun violence. O’Neal made a contribution, purchasing the boy and his family a new home and one that was wheelchair accessible. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He discussed the gesture with CNN;</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I was watching the story and it's just sad. It could have been any one of us. It could have been my son. It could've been your cousin, and she was living in a one-bedroom apartment with her two boys, so we found her a house in College Park. Nice area. I'm going to get her some Ring cameras on me. We're going to give her some furniture, TVs and pay her rent off for a year and help her get on her feet."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED -&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shaq Explains His Exotic Connection To The Tiger King</a></span></p><h2 id=cars-cars-amp-more-cars><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Cars, Cars & More Cars</span></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Shaq’s first impulse purchase was a trio of Rolls Royce rides back in the day. His love for cars hasn’t diminished, his garage is packed with huge Ford F-150s, along with everything else from a customized Vaydor do a modified Lamborghini that fits his big frame. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He relived the experience of his first impulse purchase with Vanity Fair;</a></p><p>“One day I just went in. Mike Tyson was in there buying a couple of Bentleys. I had on some shorts and a tank top and flip-flops, and I said to the salesman, ‘Sir, how much does this one cost?’ He said, ‘Can you afford it, sonny boy?’ I was so upset that I bought three Bentleys right there on the spot.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=and-custom-made-bicycles><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>And Custom-Made Bicycles</span></h2><p>Finding a bicycle that fits Shaq’s needs is no easy task. He doesn’t have a normal frame, the dude is a tower of power. It was love at first sight after he laid eyes on his new bike from Dirty Sixer. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to the store rep,</a> Shaq was like a kid on Christmas when he first saw the bicycle;</p><p>"After he first saw the DirtySixer, we exchanged a few words and he quickly went off, full speed, in the Turner studios corridors. He disappeared for a while, leaving us worried. And then he reappeared with a huge smile on his face. He said he felt that was the first time he felt normal on a bike."</p><h2 id=custom-orange-county-chopper><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Custom-Orange County Chopper</span></h2><p>Cars, bicycles, and motorcycles can be found in Shaq’s garage. Like the bikes and cars, some need to be totally custom-made.</p><p>According to TMZ, the legend Paul Teutul Sr. went out of his way to create a totally custom-bike for Shaq with his Orange-County Chopper team. As opposed to a regular 10-foot long bike, the ride was stretched out an extra four-feet to meet O’Neal’s needs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED -&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">16 Rumors Shaq Wishes Would Quietly Disappear</a></span></p><h2 id=papa-john-s-board-of-directors><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Papa John’s Board Of Directors</span></h2><p>Shaq loves to put his money down on fast food investments. That was the case years ago when he put his money down on Krispy Kreme Doughnuts out in Atlanta.</p><p>He did the same for nine Papa John’s establishments out in Atlanta – along with the investment, he would also join the Board Of Directors while earning an $8.25 million salary as an ambassador figure for the brand. Now that’s money well spent by the big man.</p><h2 id=1-15-million-atlanta-home><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>$1.15 Million Atlanta Home</span></h2><p>Shaq bought himself a beautiful estate out in Atlanta, worth over $1.15 million. The estate comes with two homes, the LA Times discussed some of the features;</p><p>“The property includes two homes, a three-stall barn, and a swimming pool on more than 14 park-like acres. A large workshop is attached to the barn.” It also includes a 10-person theater, weight, and game room along with one spacious and luxurious backyard setting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=new-rolex-for-every-laker><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>New Rolex For Every Laker</span></h2><p>We go back in time for this story that took place in the early 2000s when the Lakers were in dynasty mode. Mark Madsen revealed this story, which shows Shaq’s kind generosity. Madsen reveals that not only did Shaq buy him a car, but he also bought others various pairs of shoes. It was all topped off by a Rolex for every player on the team;</p><p>“He took me Rolex shopping. And he bought a new Rolex for every single guy on the team.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED -&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">50 Cent Roasts His Baby Momma Over Spending Money</a></span></p><h2 id=buying-a-fan-a-laptop><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Buying A Fan A Laptop</span></h2><p>Patrick Martin lived out a dream – not only did he get to meet Shaq but as he stated on Facebook, he even got a laptop out of it. Another underrated act by the big man who has a huge heart;</p><p>“So me and Mo just went to Best Buy to buy a laptop and we meet Shaq. We gave our condolences for his sister and Kobe. We walked off, then Shaq comes to us and says, I like yall, so get the nicest one in here and I'll pay for it.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=investment-in-24-hour-fitness><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Investment In 24-Hour Fitness</span></h2><p>When Shaq puts down an investment, he needs to have an interest in the brand. That was the case with his recent investment in 24-Hour Fitness, dropping some big bucks in order to put the brand in an even greater position. He discussed the partnership with Club Industry;</p><p>"I am committed to fitness and committed to Miami and thought the best way to show this was to bring the ultimate in health clubs with me. 24 Hour Fitness offers the greatest facilities out there today and I really believe in what they stand for -- fitness made fun and easy for everyone. And you'll all know I am a lot about fun so just wait until you see my Shaq-sized clubs!"</p><h2 id=google-amp-apple-investments><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Google & Apple Investments</span></h2><p>"I heard Jeff Bezos say one time [that] he makes his investments based on if it's going to change people's lives," and "once I started doing that strategy, I think I probably quadrupled what I'm worth."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That sentiment worked wonders for Shaq, as he quadrupled his investment with both Google and Apple. Clearly for Shaq, business tends to be more about his personal interest than money – though in this case, the extra money didn’t hurt!</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT –<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What We Know About Shaq’s Life Off The Court</a></span></p><p>Sources – Facebook.
