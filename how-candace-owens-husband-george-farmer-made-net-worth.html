Put simply, his name connected him to royalty, and he had access to all the resources that came with it.

Farmer, who himself holds conservative political views, saw the app gain considerable popularity from Donald Trump supporters in 2020, and in 2022 was estimated to have raised $56 million, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Reuters.</a> As a matter of fact, his political affiliation to Britain's Brexit Party, which aligned with many of Trump's supporters, was partly the reason he met with Candace Owens, who was and is a vocal Trump supporter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another Trump supporter who took interest in George Farmer's social media app was the controversial rapper and fashion designer, Kanye West.

Then, in April 2023, the digital conglomerate, Starboard, purchased Parler, for an undisclosed figure. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to sources,</a> these are the greatest achievements of George Farmer's career thus far:</p><table border=1 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=6 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Achievement</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Year</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Net Worth</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Director of Red Kite Metals</p></td><td><p>2012</p></td><td><p>$60 million</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Chairman of Turning Point U.K.</p></td><td><p>2016</p></td><td><p>$60-$80 million</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>CEO of Parler</p></td><td><p>2021</p></td><td><p>+ $56 million</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Sale of Parler to Starboard</p></td><td><p>2023</p></td><td><p>$180 million</p></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-has-george-farmer-earned-from-his-investment-in-the-daily-wire><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>How Much Has George Farmer Earned From His Investment In The Daily Wire?</span></h2><h3 id=the-daily-wire-net-worth-100-million>The Daily Wire Net Worth: $100 million</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/untitled-design-30-1.png><p>Candace Owens and George Farmer seem to be a dynamic duo when it comes to making money from social media and conservative media companies. After selling Parler to Starboard (which essentially shut down the site almost immediately after purchase), Farmer made investments in a number of US-based media outlets. One of those outlets is the conservative news website and media company, The Daily Wire, which was founded in 2015 by Ben Shapiro and Jeremy Boreing. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to CAclubindia</a>, Farmer bought a minority stake in the company, which is estimated to be worth $100 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is considered a wise move by George Farmer as his wife, Candace, has hosted her own show on The Daily Wire since 2021 called The Candace Owens Show. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Forbes</a>, in October 2022, Owens received major backlash from critics after she rushed to the defense of Kanye West's antisemitic posts.
