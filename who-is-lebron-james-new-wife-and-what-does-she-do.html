That person is his wife Savannah Brinson.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>LeBron and Savannah while do post about one another on social media, have kept their relationship out of the public as much as possible. Savannah has had front row seats<a href=#> to see LeBron James' rise</a> from being a high school basketball player to playing in the NBA and earning his title as King James. While there are <a href=#>many adorable details regarding their relationshi</a>p fans do not know about.

LeBron was on the football team and Savannah was the cheerleader on the opposing team. There was an immediate connection between Savannah and LeBron. During their chat, LeBron asked Savannah to watch him play at his high school’s basketball game, and she agreed. Savannah was impressed with how great of a basketball player LeBron was. After the game, Savannah accompanied LeBron to his team's group hangout at a restaurant after one of his games.
