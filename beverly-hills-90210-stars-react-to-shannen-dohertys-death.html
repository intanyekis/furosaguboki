Sending love and light to her family in this dark time.”</p><p>News of Doherty’s death came in the early hours of Sunday. The actress<a href=#> died at age 53</a> following a years-long battle with cancer, her publicist <strong>Leslie Sloane</strong> confirmed to Us Weekly.</p><p>“It is with a heavy heart that I confirm the passing of actress Shannen Doherty. On Saturday, July 13, she lost her battle with cancer after many years of fighting the disease,” the statement read. “The devoted daughter, sister, aunt and friend was surrounded by her loved ones as well as her dog, Bowie. The family asks for their privacy at this time so they can grieve in peace.”</p><p>Doherty <a href=#>was initially diagnosed</a> with stage IV breast cancer in 2015. She publicly announced her diagnosis in 2017, following years of remission. Years later, Doherty revealed that the cancer had <a href=#>spread to her bones</a>.</p><p>“I don’t want to die,” she told People in November 2023, offering the health update. “I’m not done with living. I’m not done with loving. I’m not done with creating. I’m not done with hopefully changing things for the better.”</p><p>Throughout her cancer battle, Doherty’s famous friends and costars have publicly shared their support and the cast of the Fox drama are no exception. Doherty played Brenda Walsh (<a href=#>twin sister to </a>Priestly’s Brandon) for four seasons of the iconic series. Her onscreen love interest <strong>Luke Perry</strong> <a href=#>died in 2019</a> after suffering a stroke at 52.</p><p>Keep scrolling to see which Beverly Hills: 90210 cast members have honored Doherty so far:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/feature-90210-Reactions.jpg><h3>Jason Priestley</h3><p>Priestley shared a throwback photo of him and Doherty while remembering his costar.</p><h3>Carol Potter</h3><p>“Shocked and saddened by news of Shannen Doherty’s death. What a journey she has been on!” Potter, who played Brenda’s mom Cindy Walsh in the series, wrote via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> on Sunday. “Gone too soon. Throughout, she stayed true to herself and gave us an example of courage and perseverance in facing her own death. May she rest in peace.❤️🙏.”</p><h3><strong>Gabrielle Carteris</strong></h3><p>“So young – so sad,” Carteris, who portrayed Andrea Zuckerman in the series, wrote via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> on Sunday. “May you RIP Shannen. I know Luke is there with open arms to love you.”</p><p>Carteris issued a separate statement to Us, writing, “Shannen was so young and so courageous. By sharing her journey she has helped so many. My heart goes out to her family and I know that Luke is welcoming her with open arms.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Stars-Remember-the-Late-Shannen-Doherty-With-Tributes-01-2024.jpg><h3>Brian Austin Green</h3><p>“Shan. My sister … you loved me through everything,” the actor, who portrayed David Silver on the series, wrote via Instagram Story on Sunday. “You were a big part of my understanding of love. I’ll miss you more than I know how to process right now. Thank you for the gift of you💔 💔.”</p><h3>Matthew Laurance</h3><p>“This is the way I choose to remember her,” Laurance, who played Mel Silver in the show, wrote via <a href=# rel=noopener>X</a> alongside a pic of a younger Doherty. “So much of her life was difficult and complicated … I had a wonderful relationship with her. And I am so grateful that four months ago I got to spend time with her for three days at the Lexington Comic Con. Our shared hugs were beautiful … Especially the last long one. May she forever be at peace now.”</p><h3>Tori Spelling</h3><p>Spelling posted via her Instagram Story on Sunday, July 14, sharing a photo of the two women hugging alongside a series of red hearts. “I don’t have outward words yet. But we knew and that’s what matters,” she captioned the photo.</p><p>On Monday, July 15, Spelling <a href=#>shared a longer tribute</a> to the late star.</p><p>“F–k them… is what Shan would say if I told her I felt pressure to have to summarize via social media a 36 year relationship and the grief I feel for a fire who’s flame went out too soon,” Spelling wrote, revealing she was 15 when they first met. “I was the boss’s daughter with no voice and she was the star with a big voice. She took me under her wing. She gave me the belief I had a voice and was worthy. We became fast best friends. We were each others wing women, true confidantes, support systems navigating bad relationships, roomates of sorts at times, travel buddies, and so much more.”</p><p>Spelling continued, “She always stuck up for me. Always had my back. Always believed in me when I didn’t or couldn’t believe in myself. We were young. We let a lot of outside and inside influences influence our friendship. In a world where we often don’t get to make up with the childhood friendships that formed so much of the adult you become, we got that chance.”</p><p>The actress noted she was “grateful” that they got the chance to become friends and would “carry the torch on” and “stay rebellious” to honor Doherty.</p><p>“She was a rebel in an era when most women didn’t feel comfortable being strong. She never tried she just was,” Spelling added. “She empowered sexiness, strength, 2 f–ks given, empathy, and all topped off with wicked humor! Her sardonic humor was one of my faves. And, no one made a frito pie like Shan!”</p><h3>Jennie Garth</h3><p>“I am still processing my tremendous grief over the loss of my long time friend Shannen,” Garth penned via <a href=# rel=noopener aria-describedby=audioeye_new_window_message>Instagram</a> next to two throwback photos of the women on set of the TV drama.</p><p>“The woman I have often described as one of the strongest people I have ever known. Our connection was real and honest,” Garth continued. “We were so often pitted against each other but none of that reflected the truth of our real relationship which was one built on mutual respect and admiration.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The What I Like About You alum continued, “She was courageous, passionate, determined and very loving and generous. I will miss her and will always honor her deeply in my heart and in my memories. My heart breaks for her family and Bowie 💔.”</p><h3>James Eckhouse</h3><p>Eckhouse, who portrayed Doherty’s father, Jim Walsh, on the teen drama, shared a throwback pic of the duo via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> on Monday, July 15.</p><p>“Such a loss. She was ferocious in her work, ferocious in her love, ferocious in her long courageous battle with cancer,” he penned. “Shannen, we will miss you dearly…”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabnaaav63FjKGgpaSjYoZxfpBpZKyskafAbr7EmpqtZaSkerS0wKelnqZdmbypsdGtsKxllJqutbSO</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbeverly-hills-90210-stars-react-to-shannen-dohertys-death.html&text=Beverly%20Hills%2c%2090210%20Stars%20React%20to%20Shannen%20Doherty%27s%20Death&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbeverly-hills-90210-stars-react-to-shannen-dohertys-death.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbeverly-hills-90210-stars-react-to-shannen-dohertys-death.html&title=Beverly%20Hills%2c%2090210%20Stars%20React%20to%20Shannen%20Doherty%27s%20Death" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbeverly-hills-90210-stars-react-to-shannen-dohertys-death.html&title=Beverly%20Hills%2c%2090210%20Stars%20React%20to%20Shannen%20Doherty%27s%20Death" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbeverly-hills-90210-stars-react-to-shannen-dohertys-death.html&title=Beverly%20Hills%2c%2090210%20Stars%20React%20to%20Shannen%20Doherty%27s%20Death" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbeverly-hills-90210-stars-react-to-shannen-dohertys-death.html&description=Beverly%20Hills%2c%2090210%20Stars%20React%20to%20Shannen%20Doherty%27s%20Death" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./how-what-not-to-wears-stacy-london-and-clinton-kelly-ended-their-feud.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How What Not to Wears Stacy London and Clinton Kelly Ended Their Feud">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./best-e-bikes-electric-bicycles-women-heights.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Best E-Bikes for Women of All Heights">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
