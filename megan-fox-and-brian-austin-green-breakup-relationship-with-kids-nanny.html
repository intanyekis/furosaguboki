On top of that, their relationship was controversial since Austin Green was 30 when they met and Fox was only 18.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Austin Green and Fox reportedly began dating in 2004, they announced their engagement in 2006.

During the resulting conversation, Fox was willing to admit to struggling after giving birth.</p><p>Unfortunately, since people often harshly judge other parents, a lot of people are reluctant to be open about how hard being a parent can be. To Fox's credit, however, she was willing to be open about how much she struggled after her first child with Austin Green was born.</p><p>"Having an infant is difficult. It's a lot of work and I didn't hire any help because I overestimated my own abilities. I had no idea how difficult babies could be, so Brian and I were exhausted.
