Even before he highly publicized relationship with one of <a href=#>Brooklyn's finest rappers, Jay-Z</a>, she has always been an example of ambition to women everywhere, and in every field. It's no wonder that she dominates in every industry she steps foot in, whether that be as a multi-platinum record winning music artist, a show-stealing live performer, or a captivating actress - she leaves a lasting mark in every sphere of influence. Because of this, she is highly esteemed for her electric performances, and has made a killing in the process. Here are eight of the biggest paychecks of Beyoncé for live shows.</p><h2 id=dubai-atlantis-the-royal-live-show---24-million>Dubai Atlantis The Royal Live Show - $24 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To kick things off, on January 21, 2023, <a href=#>the 41-year-old Queen Bey</a> reportedly topped the list of The 10 Most Expensive Private Performances with her stunning display held at the Atlantic The Royal Resort in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Forbes</a>, she earned a whopping $24 million for her performance which lasted only one hour! There isn't a job in the world that pays that much for an hour of your time! Her performance also featured an orchestra of 48 females, along with her daughter, Blue Ivy.<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Style Caster informs us</a> that a few of the attendees at her concert were <a href=#>model and social media personality Kendall Jenner</a>, actors Rebel Wilson and Letitia Wright, and fellow musicians Halle Bailey and Chlöe.</p><h2 id=coachella-2018---8-million>Coachella (2018) - $8 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The superstar R&B and pop singer has been setting records for her live stage performances since she was in the prime of her music career. One of her most iconic shows was at the 2018 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, where she put on two stunning performances, each paying her $4 million, totaling to $8 million combined for the two shows. This wasn't without some controversy, however, as it was reported that <a href=#>musician Ariana Grande</a> was also paid the same amount for her performances in 2019. But after her most recent Dubai performance, Beyoncé has reminded us why she is revered as the Queen of Pop!</p><h2 id=on-the-run-2---5-28-million>On The Run 2 - $5.28 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When you think of the term "power couple" in 2023, who really comes to mind? While some many say Cardi B and Offset or even <a href=#>Will Smith and Jada Pinkett </a>(although that's hardly believable for some), Jay-Z and Beyoncé are still the ideal picture of a celebrity power couple. So for their On The Run 2 tour in 2018, the already monumentally <a href=#>successful rap career</a> of Jay-Z and the increasing stardom of Beyoncé set them up to sell over 2 million tickets for the show. Overall, they grossed $235.5 million for their entire tour, which calculates at $5.28 million per show, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Complex.&nbsp;</a></p><h2 id=formation-world-tour---5-22-million>Formation World Tour - $5.22 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2016, Beyoncé yet again shocked the world with her performance at the Formation World Tour, following the rumors that her husband, Jay-Z, had cheated on her, which many sources suggest was true. Despite the public backlash, and her obvious disappointment over the entire ordeal, she pushed through with the show and even performed her hit single, Halo, which she ironically dedicated to Jay-Z, although <a href=#>actor Michael Ealy</a>&nbsp;was the man she sang to in the music video. The Grammy-winning artist sold a total of 2.2 million tickets and averaged $5.2 million per show, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to The Hollywood Reporter</a>. With figures like that, she can be convinced that Girls Run the World.</p><p><span class=related-single><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's How Beyonce Earns And Spends Her $500 Million Fortune</a></strong></span></p><h2 id=on-the-run-2014---5-21-million>On The Run (2014) - $5.21 Million</h2><p>In 2014, Bey's first On The Run tour with her husband Jay-Z set the precedence for the success of their second successful tour with over $100 million sold in ticket sales, making them the second top-earning tour of all time, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Black Entertainment Television (BET).</a> Although the tour was spread between France, Georgia, and, and New York Tri-state area, The Carters were able to rake in a cool $5.2 million per show. This was the couple's first joint tour, but inspired by its sold-out success, it definitely wasn't their last. It's for this reason that they are one of the <a href=#>10 Richest Hollywood Power Couples.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-beyonc-experience-new-york---2-7-million>The&nbsp;Beyoncé Experience (New York) - $2.7 Million</h2><p>To date, across the span of her career, the actress and singer has earned over $767.3 million from her live performances and sold 8.9 million tickets, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Billboard.</a> Her 2007 tour for The Beyoncé Experience was staged in support of her 2006 album, B'Day, and consisted of a total of 96 shows. Her list of songs performed included the tracks such as Dangerously in Love, as well as the song "Listen" from the Dreamgirls movie soundtrack, in which she starred alongside <a href=#>comedians Jamie Foxx</a> and Eddie Murphy, as well as fellow singer-songwriter Jennifer Hudson. The highest-grossing recorded concert was at Madison Square Garden in New York, and grossed over $2.7 million.</p><h2 id=solo-tour-2013---1-87-million>SOLO Tour (2013) - $1.87 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although her Savage Fenty X clothing brand has made her into one of the few female billionaires in the world, not even Rihanna was ever able to out-perform Beyoncé in her prime, although her Diamonds Tour grossed a total of $141.9 million. The Queen Bey grossed $1.87 million per show for her SOLO Tour in 2013, totaling $229.7 million for 123 shows in total. Back then, she was earning a noticeably lower rate per show. Her stardom has caused her to rub shoulders with other <a href=#>pop icons like Madonna</a>, who has been said to earn $17.5 million per live show.</p><h2 id=verizon-ladies-first-tour---40k---80k>Verizon Ladies First Tour - $40k - $80k</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Taking in way back to 2004 with the Verizon Ladies First Tour, this was when Beyoncé had just released her debut studio album, Dangerously In Love. She was commissioned to headline the tour alongside <a href=#>recording artists Alicia Keys</a>&nbsp;and Missy 'Misdemeanor' Elliot. She had recently parted ways with the Destiny's Child trio and was just beginning her ascent up the ladder as an A-list celebrity. This was her breakout moment as it was understood that Beyoncé was the star of the show. At the time, she grossed between $40k and $80k per show. She certainly has come a long way since then!</p><p><span class=next-single><strong>READ NEXT: <a href=#>The 10 Richest Hollywood Power Couples (And Their Net Worth)</a></strong></span></p><p>Sources:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Style Caster</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Complex</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BET</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Billboard</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBqbGMm6Cgn5WowW68wLKaoZ2ToMBuu8VmmZ6xn6OwpnnFqKlmpJmrsm68xKudqKqdlruksdJmqZqmm5qxcA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-biggest-paychecks-of-beyonce-for-live-performances-ranked.html&text=The%20Biggest%20Paychecks%20Of%20Beyonc%20For%20Live%20Performances%2c%20Ranked&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-biggest-paychecks-of-beyonce-for-live-performances-ranked.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-biggest-paychecks-of-beyonce-for-live-performances-ranked.html&title=The%20Biggest%20Paychecks%20Of%20Beyonc%20For%20Live%20Performances%2c%20Ranked" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-biggest-paychecks-of-beyonce-for-live-performances-ranked.html&title=The%20Biggest%20Paychecks%20Of%20Beyonc%20For%20Live%20Performances%2c%20Ranked" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-biggest-paychecks-of-beyonce-for-live-performances-ranked.html&title=The%20Biggest%20Paychecks%20Of%20Beyonc%20For%20Live%20Performances%2c%20Ranked" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-biggest-paychecks-of-beyonce-for-live-performances-ranked.html&description=The%20Biggest%20Paychecks%20Of%20Beyonc%20For%20Live%20Performances%2c%20Ranked" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./1427500-ethan-page-reveals-what-made-him-request-a-run-in-ring-of-honor.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ethan Page Reveals What Made Him Request A Run In Ring Of Honor">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./stars-who-beat-cancer-20101110.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Stars Who Beat Cancer: Photos">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
