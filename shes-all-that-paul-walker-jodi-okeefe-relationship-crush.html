In reality, however, everyone knows that it isn’t a coincidence that most people who make it big in Hollywood are extremely good-looking. As a side effect of that fact, the vast majority of film and television sets are overrun with staggeringly attractive lead actors. With that in mind, it makes perfect sense that a lot of <a href=#>co-stars have dated</a> over the years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Co-Stars Who Fell In Love On The Set Of A Comedy</a></span></p><p>Given the fact that movie stars tend to have easy access to whatever they want, it can be hard to imagine famous actors wanting something they will never have. That said, there are many examples of <a href=#>stars who’ve admitted to having a crush on a celebrity</a> that they would never go on to date. For example, one of the people who starred in She’s All That once admitted to having a crush on Paul Walker.</p><h2 id=people-have-been-reexamining-she-rsquo-s-all-that>People Have Been Reexamining She’s All That</h2><p>In the vast majority of cases, movies are largely forgotten not long after they come out. On the other hand, some movies manage to make enough of a mark on viewers that people continue to discuss them for years. When She’s All That was released in 1999, it didn’t necessarily seem like the type of film that people would still care about decades later. Despite that, the fact that <a href=#>She’s All That got a gender-swapped remake</a> in 2021 proves how relevant the film remains decades later.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Rachael Leigh Cook Returns On Gender-Flipped Remake Of Cult Romcom ‘She’s All That’</a></span></p><p>Due to the fact that He’s All That was released in 2021, a lot of people who hadn’t seen She’s All that in years have gone back to watch the original film. Just like the majority of movies, there were aspects of She’s All That which haven’t aged well in the slightest. On top of that, there were some parts of She’s All That which a lot of people had issues with when the film was first released including the message the film sends to women.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As a result of the fact that many people have been discovering and remembering the issues that She’s All That, people have been reexamining the film’s legacy. Amazingly enough, however, the vast majority of people have continued to adore She’s All That even as they are frank about the problematic aspects of the film. For example, a 2019 Cosmopolitan headline called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She’s All That “a great teen movie with a horrible message for women”</a>.</p><h2 id=jodi-lyn-o-39-keefe-admits-to-having-a-crush-on-paul-walker>Jodi Lyn O'Keefe Admits To Having A Crush On Paul Walker</h2><p>Most of the time when people talk about She’s All That, two actors come to mind first and foremost, Freddie Prinze Jr. and Rachael Leigh Cook. Despite that, several notable stars appeared in She’s All That including Usher, Lil’ Kim, Kevin Pollak, Kieran Culkin, and Matthew Lillard. In fact, Lillard even briefly steals the movie’s spotlight when he performs a hilariously egotistical dance in character. On top of all those actors, She’s All That wouldn’t have worked without Jodi Lyn O'Keefe and Paul Walker’s performances in the film.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everything Rachael Leigh Cook Has Done Since 'She's All That'</a></span></p><p>Cast as two characters that set the film’s story in action, Jodi Lyn O'Keefe’s Taylor breaks up with Freddie Prinze Jr.’s Zack and Paul Walker’s Dean makes the bet that brings Laney into the story. In addition to playing a role in She’s All That’s fictional love story, O’Keefe and Walker apparently were involved in a one-way romance behind the scenes. After all, in 2015 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">O’Keefe told Cosmopolitan that she had a crush on Walker</a> when they made the movie together.</p><p>While talking to Cosmopolitan, Jodi Lyn O'Keefe was asked if she ever got involved with any of her She’s All That co-stars. Without missing a beat, O’Keefe revealed she didn’t date any of her co-stars in the film but she wanted to. “I did not hook up with anyone. I think you walk onto a set filled with all of these beautiful people and secretly want to hook up with everyone.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Clearly sensing a scoop, the Cosmopolitan interviewer asked Jodi Lyn O'Keefe which one of her She’s All That co-stars she had a crush on. Completely forthright in response, O’Keefe identified which of her She’s All That co-stars she had feelings for while revealing she wasn’t the only one.</p><p>“Instantly, Paul Walker. I was like, "What is that beautiful human being?" I think we all felt that way, like, we all walked onto the set and it was like, "Who is this Adonis?" He was a doll baby, that's what I called him. He was just one of the sweetest men I'd ever met.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Here’s Why Fans Think M.
