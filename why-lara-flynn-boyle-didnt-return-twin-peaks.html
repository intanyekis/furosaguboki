In 2017, Showtime aired a limited series that would serve as third season, starring most of the show's original cast. This revival of the show saw one notable absence: that of Lara Flynn Boyle, who played Laura Palmer's best friend Donna Hayward.</p><p>It isn't clear why Flynn Boyle didn't return to 'Twin Peaks' on its latest season, but there are a few explanations for that we're going to explore in this feature.</p><h2 id=what-is-39-twin-peaks-39-about>What Is 'Twin Peaks' About?</h2><p>Premiered in 1990 on ABC, the series revolves around the murder of teenage girl Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee) in the town of Twin Peaks, Washington.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 1989, FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) gets into Twin Peaks to investigate the murder. Everyone who knew Laura is willing to help, including her well-meaning best friend Donna and a series of bizarre, quirky characters that may have a skeleton or two in their closets. Nothing is as it seems in Twin Peaks, as fans know, and the plot thickens, leading Cooper to make some unsettling discoveries.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Where Is 'Twin Peaks' Star Sherilyn Fenn Now?</a></span></p><p>Take this as your (light) spoiler warning if you have never watched the series, or the prequel film, 'Fire Walk With Me', released in 1992.</p><p>In the first season, Donna is distraught by Laura's death and seeks solace in the arms of Laura's secret lover, biker James Hurley (James Marshall). The two investigate Laura's murder and double life (also explored in prequel 'Fire Walk With Me,' where Donna is played by 'One Tree Hill' star Moira Kelly).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The second season revealed Laura's killer (though we won't say who did it!), and took a turn for the weirdest, with Cooper continuing being involved in the town's secrets.</p><p>As for the revival, it is set 25 years after the original 'Twin Peaks' and follows different storylines, also focusing on Cooper and his investigation into Laura's murder. But no trace of Flynn Boyle.</p><h2 id=why-was-lara-flynn-boyle-replaced-in-39-twin-peaks-fire-walk-with-me-39>Why Was Lara Flynn Boyle Replaced In 'Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me'?</h2><p>Released in 1992, 'Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me' explores the last seven days in the life of Laura Palmer.</p><p>The film was written by Lynch and Robert Engels and saw the return of many cast members, with the exception of Flynn Boyle as Donna. The character was played by Moira Kelly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sherilyn Fenn, who plays the reckless, sultry Audry Horne in the series, also chose not to appear in the film, and neither did Richard Beymer, who portrayed Audrey's father, hotelier Ben Horne.</p><p>At the time, Boyle's absence was put down to scheduling conflicts, possibly with 'Wayne's World', also released in 1992. However, her not being on the prequel lead to speculations that she didn't want to work with her ex MacLachlan. The two were together from 1990 to 1992.</p><h2 id=boyle-was-blamed-for-the-39-twin-peaks-39-romance-that-never-happened>Boyle Was Blamed For The 'Twin Peaks' Romance That Never Happened</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/sherilyn-fenn-lara-flynn-boyle-twin-peaks.jpg><p>In a podcast interview Fenn gave in 2017, the actress blamed a missed storyline for her character Audrey on Boyle and MacLachlan's romance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the first season, Cooper books a room in the hotel owned by Audrey's father, resulting in her and the FBI agent spending time together. Audrey also investigates her father's possible involvement in Laura's death to win the heart of Agent Cooper, of who she is infatuated. Despite their chemistry, a romance between the two characters was never incorporated in the script.</p><p>For Fenn, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this was Boyle's fault</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Crazy Truth About How Madeline Zima Was Cast In 'Twin Peaks'</a></span></p><p>"So his girlfriend, Lara Flynn Boyle, kiboshes an astonishing thing… I remember saying, 'David, is this how it goes? An actor complains, because she’s the girlfriend, and then you change?'" she said on the 'Twin Peaks Unwrapped' podcast.</p><p>"Now, Kyle will admit the truth. Then, he wouldn't. At the time, he was saying, 'No, [her] character is too young for me,'" Fenn continued.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Meanwhile he is with a girlfriend," she then said of Boyle, who was 19 at the time, while Fenn was in her mid-20s.</p><p>In season two, 'Austin Powers' star Heather Graham joined the show as Annie, becoming Cooper's love interest.</p><p>"And they bring in Heather, who's younger, so… whatever," Fenn commented.</p><h2 id=so-why-isn-39-t-lara-flynn-boyle-in-39-twin-peaks-39-season-three>So, Why Isn't Lara Flynn Boyle In 'Twin Peaks' Season Three?</h2><p>As we said, Boyle didn't return as Donna in the revival of 'Twin Peaks'.</p><p>While the reason was never made public, it is possible that her character was just not needed for that particular series as the character was not supposed to be in Twin Peaks.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the book by co-creator Frost, 'Twin Peaks: The Final Dossier', <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Donna moved to New York City</a> after high school and cut ties with her family and friends. She studied at Hunter College, but dropped out to focus on her modeling career. She married an older venture capitalist and became addicted to drug and alcohol.</p><p>After going missing and being found in a crack house (an episode that might have triggered the death of her mother), Donna decides to get sober and divorce her husband. Later on, she relocated to Connecticut and then reconnected with her father, moving in with him in Vermont and studying to become a nurse.</p><h2 id=boyle-on-her-audition-for-39-twin-peaks-39>Boyle On Her Audition For 'Twin Peaks'</h2><p>In recent years, Boyle went on to star in independent movies, including 'Men In Black II' and, more recently, independent productions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When promoting her 2020 movie 'Death in Texas', the actress was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">asked about memorable auditions</a>, inevitably looking back on reading for the role of Donna in 'Twin Peaks'.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Is What David Lynch Really Says About His Cult-Classic, 'Eraserhead'</a></span></p><p>"I remember when I auditioned for 'Twin Peaks,' and I met with David Lynch and Mark Frost. I went in to read for them at Propaganda Films. David Lynch was telling me just tiny bits about what 'Twin Peaks' was about, and after he explained it, I said, 'Well, if it's about the dead girl, then why am I reading if I’m supposed to be dead?' He said, 'No, you're not reading for the dead girl.' That I remember," she told 'The Hollywood Reporter'.</p><p>As a fourth season of 'Twin Peaks' is not entirely off the table, at least according to Lynch, there is a small chance that Boyle might reprise the role, after all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>David Lynch Just Dropped An Eerie DIY Short On His YouTube</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdoa6zrYyfo7KmnmKvsMXLnmSdoZSjwW6%2BxK2sq6ZdqcSquoypnJqjo2Q%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhy-lara-flynn-boyle-didnt-return-twin-peaks.html&text=Why%20Didn%27t%20Lara%20Flynn%20Boyle%20Return%20To%20%27Twin%20Peaks%27%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-lara-flynn-boyle-didnt-return-twin-peaks.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-lara-flynn-boyle-didnt-return-twin-peaks.html&title=Why%20Didn%27t%20Lara%20Flynn%20Boyle%20Return%20To%20%27Twin%20Peaks%27%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhy-lara-flynn-boyle-didnt-return-twin-peaks.html&title=Why%20Didn%27t%20Lara%20Flynn%20Boyle%20Return%20To%20%27Twin%20Peaks%27%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-lara-flynn-boyle-didnt-return-twin-peaks.html&title=Why%20Didn%27t%20Lara%20Flynn%20Boyle%20Return%20To%20%27Twin%20Peaks%27%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-lara-flynn-boyle-didnt-return-twin-peaks.html&description=Why%20Didn%27t%20Lara%20Flynn%20Boyle%20Return%20To%20%27Twin%20Peaks%27%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./wrestler-lex-luger-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Wrestler Lex Luger Net Worth  How Much is Wrestler Lex Luger Worth?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./usher-prepping-role-sugar-ray-leonard-153090.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Usher Prepping for Role As Sugar Ray Leonard">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
