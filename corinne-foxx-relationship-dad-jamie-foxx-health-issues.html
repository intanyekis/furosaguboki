However, with Foxx's recent health scare, things appear to have taken a drastic turn. So, how exactly has the once-rocky relationship between Foxx and his daughter changed?</p><h2 id=does-corinne-foxx-get-along-with-her-parents>Does Corinne Foxx Get Along With Her Parents?</h2><p>Academy Award winner Jamie Foxx is adored worldwide for many traits—his unquestionable acting prowess, magnetic charisma, and larger-than-life personality.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, when it came to raising his firstborn daughter, Corinne Foxx, these traits didn’t win him much favor. The duo repeatedly clashed over Jamie’s penchant for embarrassing Corinne with his over-the-top antics.</p><p>“My dad was very over-the-top, very charismatic,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she shared with New York Post in 2021</a>. “I was more reserved and quiet so we had these funny moments of tension or him embarrassing me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/corinne-jamie.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Corinne</a>, the renowned comedian would wear “clothing that is too young for him” and go out of his way to intimidate her boyfriends by knocking on their doors. “I think we always had this yin and yang relationship,” she admitted to New York Post, “he was really over-the-top and I was more reserved and that’s where in my teenage years a lot of conflicts happened.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though the now 29-year-old has since come to appreciate the humor in Foxx’s parenting style, she wasn’t exactly his biggest fan as a teenager.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/corinne-foxx-s-turbulent-relationship-with-dad-jamie-foxx-changed-drastically-with-news-of-his-health-problems.jpg><p>“When you look at these stories now you can laugh, they’re hilarious. When you’re in the moment and it’s happening to you and you’re a teenager and everything feels like the end of the world,” she explained to New York Post. “It felt like the worst thing that could happen was him showing up at my soccer game in a tight leather jacket. ‘Gosh, why is he doing this?!

Though the 29-year-old rarely discusses her mother in interviews, she has shared a few heartfelt tributes that hint at a strong bond with her.</p><p>"I could not be more honored to say that my mother served for the United States Air Force. She glows with pride and strength for her country & service," she shared on her Instagram in November 2014.
