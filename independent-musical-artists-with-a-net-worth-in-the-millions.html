According to <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NPR</a>, as defined by Johnathan Waits, an independent artist is someone who's "grassroots" and does their own "social networking." NPR's Lloyd Black chimed in and explained that an independent artist is responsible for financially backing themselves. A woman named Brooke chimed in and explained that someone can be independent but still be with a label. So, what IS an independent artist???</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Singers Who Were Sabotaged By Their Label</a></span></p><p><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a> offers one of the most straightforward definitions, closer to Wait's perspective. In short, independent music has a "'do-it-yourself' approach to recording and publishing." Since the 1990s, the number of independent artists has increased globally. The benefit of this DIY approach is that an artist will own 100% of their music. However, without a label backing them or a solid fan base, not all independent artists thrive. <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">These musical artists, however, are with their estimated net worth being in the millions</a>.</p><h2 id=mya-5-million><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Mya: $5 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>R&B singer Mya went independent around 2018. Billboard interviewed the "Lady Marmalade" singer on what it's like to be independent. She expressed that she had to learn to have patience because when creating a body of work, she becomes "tunnel-visioned out." Mya stays in the house and doesn't eat or sleep until she completes something. Mya released her last album, "TKO," in 2018, commemorating the anniversary of her first album, "Mýa," which came out in 1998. One of the album's songs, "GMO" (Got My Own), featured singer and rapper Tink, an independent artist. <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tink had label issues allegedly because of Timbaland</a>.</p><h2 id=tinashe-6-million><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Tinashe: $6 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tinashe's highest-charting song is "2 On", which peaked at #24 on the Hot Billboard 100. The song blew up, and then it seemed that Tinashe never became as big as many people thought she should have been. According to<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Indie</a>, RCA put Tinashe in an "ill-fitting pop box" rather than let her explore R&B-inspired sounds.</p><p>Tinashe admitted that she hates people telling her what to do, and it's harder to express your creative side when there is a team working on your behalf. Around 2019, Tinashe went independent via Tinashe Music label, and her latest song is "Bouncin'," which has over 1 million views on YouTube currently. Her latest album "Comfort & Joy" came out in 2020.</p><h2 id=ashanti-8-million><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Ashanti: $8 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ashanti was an early 2000s staple</a>. Her duets features with Ja Rule and other rappers were feel-good classics. The "Foolish" singer has ten top 10 hits and two #1's. Around 2011, Ashanti became an independent artist on her record label Written Entertainment with eOne Music. In 2014, Ashanti released her sixth studio album "Braveheart." The album had collaborations with French Montana, Jeremih, and Rick Ross. The album went to #10 on the Hot Billboard 200 charts. Her latest song, "2:35 (I Want You), came out about six months ago, and the music video has over 1 million views on YouTube.</p><h2 id=imogen-heap-10-million><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Imogen Heap: $10 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>English singer Imogen Heap is known for her interesting take on electropop music. Imogen Heap released her second studio album, "Speak for Yourself," on Megaphonic Records. The album went gold in the United States and Canada. This album spawned her ever-popular song "Hide and Seek," which reached gold status as well. People had a newfound interest in the song when Jason Derulo sampled it in his 2009 hit song "Whatcha Say." which went to #1.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jason Derulo Makes More On TikTok Than From His Music Career</a></span></p><h2 id=e-40-10-million><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>E-40: $10 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>E-40's highest-charting song is "I Don't F**k With You," featuring Big Sean. E-40 is known for being the rapper who sold CDs out of his trunk, and obviously, that has taken him far. According to <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vice</a>, in the mid-80s, E-40 was selling mixtapes out of his car for his group, The Click. He sold these CDs specifically at M&M Liquors in South Vallejo, California. Funny enough, E-40 also has a malt liquor brand which probably adds to his net worth. His latest song called "I Stand On That" came out around four months ago and featured Joyner Lucas and T.I. "I Stand On That" has over 12 million views on YouTube.</p><h2 id=frank-ocean-13-million><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Frank Ocean: $13 Million</span></h2><p>In 2016, Frank Ocean amassed around $1 million being an independent artist, and now that number has only multiplied. The "Thinkin' Bout You" singer makes a lot of money from digital sales. His album "Blonde" peaked at #1 on the Billboard 200 in 2016. His album "Channel Orange" went to #2 on the Billboard 200 in 2012. His last official album was "Endless," a visual album, and <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fans are always wondering what he's up to </a>and when his next album will appear.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tech-n9ne-18--20-million><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Tech N9ne: $18-$20 Million</span></h2><p>Tech N9ne got his name from the rapper Black Walt comparing his fast rapping style TEC-9 semi-automatic handgun. Music sales, merchandise, and touring are the reasons behind his net worth. Kendrick Lamar has expressed that his work ethic is crazy. Tech N9ne has four top 10 songs on the Billboard 200. His only song to land on the Billboard is the song "Hood Go Crazy," featuring rappers B.o.B and 2 Chainz. Nonetheless, Tech N9ne is doing something right.</p><h2 id=hanson-20-million><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Hanson: $20 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you grew up in the 90s and loved Pop music, you most likely couldn't get "MMM Bop" out of your head. In 1997, the song went to #1. The Hanson brothers own 3CG Records and parted from the label in 2003. The Masked Singer contestants struggled with Island Def Jam because the label refused over 80 songs from the brothers, expressing the songs lacked marketability.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The 10 Richest 'The Masked Singer' Contestants, Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><h2 id=macklemore-25-million><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Macklemore: $25 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Thrift Shop" and "Can't Hold Us" went to #1 in 2013. Who could ever forget the song that focused on shopping at a thrift shop versus promoting designer brands? The story behind "Thrift Shop" going to #1 is that Macklemore and Ryan Lewis got Alternative Distribution Alliance, a subsidiary of Warner Music Group, to get their music into stores. However, they did not have a deal with Warner Music Group themselves or any other label. Like most acts, the group spent time performing at small clubs, and they built a following on Twitter, Tumblr, and YouTube.</p><h2 id=chance-the-rapper-25-million><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Chance The Rapper: $25 Million</span></h2><p>It's often been debated if Chance The Rapper is genuinely an independent artist. <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Trapital </a>reported that Apple Music gave Chance The Rapper "$500,000, two commercials, and premiere placement on the streaming service in exchange for two weeks of exclusivity for his Grammy Award-winning Coloring Book." However, the "No Problem" rapper argued that it was a short-term business deal. Many people would argue that an indie artist is merely anyone not signed to a label, which Chance technically isn't. In 2016, Kanye West's GOOD Music offered to sign him, but he refused.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Truth About The Album That Made Chance The Rapper Famous</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGigp5yVpbKvsMSnq2alpai2pK3LZpirrJmowbR51qKroWWRYrumwIywpqusmGK2r3nToZxmpZmhuaq7zaxm</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2findependent-musical-artists-with-a-net-worth-in-the-millions.html&text=Independent%20Musical%20Artists%20With%20A%20Net%20Worth%20In%20The%20Millions&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2findependent-musical-artists-with-a-net-worth-in-the-millions.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2findependent-musical-artists-with-a-net-worth-in-the-millions.html&title=Independent%20Musical%20Artists%20With%20A%20Net%20Worth%20In%20The%20Millions" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2findependent-musical-artists-with-a-net-worth-in-the-millions.html&title=Independent%20Musical%20Artists%20With%20A%20Net%20Worth%20In%20The%20Millions" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2findependent-musical-artists-with-a-net-worth-in-the-millions.html&title=Independent%20Musical%20Artists%20With%20A%20Net%20Worth%20In%20The%20Millions" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2findependent-musical-artists-with-a-net-worth-in-the-millions.html&description=Independent%20Musical%20Artists%20With%20A%20Net%20Worth%20In%20The%20Millions" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jessica-simpsons-best-quotes-about-motherhood-and-kids.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jessica Simpsons Best Quotes About Motherhood and Kids">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./how-tia-mowrys-natural-hair-journey-helped-start-her-business.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Tia Mowrys Natural Hair Journey Helped Start Her Business">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
