Franco's stoner character provided much-needed comedic relief for an otherwise tense season of the hit series. Eduardo Franco told the New York Times that he liked that he was able to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"bring a breath of fresh air to the chaos that ensues in the show."</a></p><h2 id=eduardo-franco-originally-auditioned-for-the-role-of-eddie><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Eduardo Franco Originally Auditioned For The Role Of Eddie</span></h2><p>Though it may be hard to imagine this season playing out any other way, Eduardo Franco <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">originally auditioned to play the role of Eddie.</a> The part of Eddie ended up going to Joseph Quinn instead, but there are no hard feelings. Eduardo graciously told Insider, "I'm so happy it went to Joseph Quinn [...] They made a beautiful decision.

In Booksmart, Eduardo's comedic timing fit right in with his role as Theo. Finn Wolfhard, who plays Mike Wheeler on Stranger Things, watched Booksmart and recommended Eduardo Franco for the role of Argyle. Like with Stranger Things, Eduardo did not originally audition to play Theo in the film. Rather, Olivia Wilde and her casting director created Theo specifically for Eduardo.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-has-eduardo-franco-said-about-filming-stranger-things><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>What Has Eduardo Franco Said About Filming Stranger Things?</span></h2><p>Eduardo Franco has spoken very positively about his experience filming Stranger Things. Though he was a newbie to the cast this season, he enjoyed working with the tight-knit group. He told the New York Times that his favorite scene to film was the dinner table scene because he was able to get some laughs out of his fellow cast mates. He said, "I love going to work and making people laugh [...] And everything felt so organic, sharing the screen with Charlie, Finn, and everyone."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Jamie Campbell Bower Totally Lost Himself Playing His Twisted Stranger Things Character">Jamie Campbell Bower Totally Lost Himself Playing His Twisted Stranger Things Character</a></span></p><h2 id=eduardo-franco-was-one-of-several-new-actors-to-join-the-stranger-things-family-this-season><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Eduardo Franco Was One Of Several New Actors To Join The Stranger Things Family This Season</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Eduardo Franco was not the only new addition to the cast of Stranger Things this season. Joseph Quinn also joined the cast to play new fan favorite Eddie, leading to the now viral TikTok sound "Chrissy, Wake Up!"

This hair is less of a stylistic choice as it is a practical one. Eduardo admitted to Remezcla that his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">aunt would cut his hair as a kid</a>. Since his aunt lived in Mexico, along with a lot of his family, he had to cross the U.S. border to get back into the States after his visits. He said he would have to "sometimes wait in line one or two hours," so he just stopped getting his hair cut as a teenager.</p><h2 id=eduardo-franco-is-also-a-rapper><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Eduardo Franco Is Also A Rapper</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Eduardo Franco is not only a talented actor, but he is a talented rapper as well.
