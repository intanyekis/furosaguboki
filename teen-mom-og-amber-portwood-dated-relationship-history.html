After Portwood became pregnant at 18, the two were featured on the MTV docu-series that chronicled the lives and struggles of young parents. Shirley <strong>famously proposed to Portwood with a ring he purchased at Wal-Mart,</strong> but the two ultimately called off their engagement. Due to Portwood’s substance abuse and legal issues, Shirley was granted full custody of Leah in 2011.
