Diana’s son Evan <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>married singer&nbsp;</a><strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Ashlee Simpson</a>&nbsp;</strong>in 2014. Ashlee had her first son&nbsp;<strong>Bronx,&nbsp;</strong>12, back in 2008 with her first husband, Fall Out Boy bassist<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> <strong>Pete Wentz</strong>.</a> In a 2018 <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Watch What Happens Live</a>&nbsp;interview, Evan revealed that he’s close with Pete, and he offered props to the&nbsp;From Under The Cork Tree&nbsp;musician. “He’s such an amazing father,” he said. “He knows that I love his son very much.”</p><h2><strong>Raif-Henok Emmanuel Kendrick</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/diana-ross-grandchildren-raif-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Diana’s oldest daughter Rhonda has been married to Jazz musician&nbsp;<strong>Rodney Kendrick,&nbsp;</strong>61, since 1996, and she gave birth to their son&nbsp;<strong>Raif,&nbsp;</strong>12, in 2009. Raif is incredibly worldly for his age, being fluent in French, Spanish and Mandarin, according to his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>mom’s website</a>. He also stole the show at the 2019 Grammy Awards when he introduced his grandma with a sweet speech. “Young people like me can look up to her for her independence, confidence, and her willingness to be her unique-self,” he said about his grandma!</p><h2><strong>Callaway Lane Faulkner</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>Diana’s third daughter&nbsp;<strong>Chudney&nbsp;</strong>has been married to&nbsp;<strong>Joshua Faulkner&nbsp;</strong>since 2015, but before they tied the knot, they had&nbsp;<strong>Callaway,&nbsp;</strong>9, in September 2012, via&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Us Weekly</a>. Chudney penned a heartfelt message to her daughter to celebrate her first day of third grade in September 2021. “She loves math, science and reading, but most looks forward to playing with her friends and making new ones!” she wrote.</p><h2><strong>Jagger Snow Ross</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-13>Ashlee Simpson had her first daughter (and first child with Evan) in July 2015. She announced that she’d had&nbsp;<strong>Jagger,&nbsp;</strong>6, on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram.</a> “We are overjoyed about the birth of our precious baby girl,” the pair wrote. Jagger looks so much like her dad, and the two seem very close.

She shared a photo announcing her and Joshua’s new addition, with Everlee’s older sister in the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photo.</a> “We did it! We had a baby!” she wrote. “Mama, Dada and Callaway are over the moon in love and exhausted!” Chudney celebrated her daughter’s second birthday by posting a photo of her as a newborn and a picture of her now.</p><h2><strong>Ziggy Blu Ross</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-25>Evan and Ashlee had their second son&nbsp;<strong>Ziggy,&nbsp;</strong>1, in October 2020. The family showed off their fabulous Halloween costumes this year on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>, with Ashlee dressed as Cruella Deville, and Ziggy was an adorable Dalmatian.
