The real estate mogul-turned-reality TV star and his family have grabbed a fair share of the headlines in recent times. He has been shrouded in several allegations, including tax evasions and bankruptcy filings. There has also been a messy family drama involving a tangled web of backstabbing, alleged extortion, and even sex tape allegations. All the aforementioned controversies and more have contributed to the fans’ growing interest in Todd Chrisley and his family.

He hails from a family of five. His father’s name is Gene Raymond, while his mother’s name is Faye. He also has two younger brothers named Randy and Derrick. Even though he was born in Georgia, Chrisley spent his formative years in Westminster, South Carolina, and completed his high school diploma there. He subsequently delved into the real estate sector, where he spent several years, buying and flipping homes. He was quite good at what he did and soon built a significant fortune from it.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Following his second marriage, Todd Chrisley relocated to Atlanta and continued his real estate business there. He and his family also began a reality TV series called Chrisley Knows Best on the USA Network. The show</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;chronicles the day-to-day lives of the entire Chrisley family, including all the inherent intrigues, their flamboyant lifestyle, as well as the unavoidable family drama. </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Chrisley Knows Best</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true> debuted in 2014 and has received mixed critical reviews. It, however, has high viewership and has thus remained a major fixture on the USA Network.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=his-marital-life-and-domestic-violence-allegations></span> <span data-preserver-spaces=true><strong>His Marital Life and Domestic Violence </strong></span><strong>Allegations</strong><br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Although he is rumored to be gay, Todd Chrisley has been married twice, and both unions have been with women. His first marriage was to his high school sweetheart, Teresa Terry, in 1990. The union produced two children namely son, Kyle Chrisley, and daughter, Lindsie Chrisley, and the couple subsequently went their separate ways in 1996. Afterward, Terry revealed that Todd was physically and emotionally abusive during their marriage.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In an exclusive interview with MailOnline in 2014, she alleged that he once stripped her naked and battered her with his closed fist. She also claimed that he once hired a private detective to track her down. Todd has never responded to these claims but is enjoying marital bliss with his present wife, Julie Chrisley. He and Julie tied the knot in 1996 and has thus far welcomed three children namely Grayson, Chase, and Savannah.&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=did-you-know-he-also-has-strained-relationship-with-some-of-his-children></span><strong>Did You Know He Also Has Strained Relationship with Some of His Children?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>All of Todd’s five children previously participated in the family’s reality TV series. This is, however, no longer the case as there have been some deep cracks in the family. For instance, the eldest daughter, Lindsie, left the show in 2017 after her dad reportedly frowned at her marriage to her husband, Will Campbell. She now co-hosts a podcast, known as </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Coffee Convos</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, but has not been able to escape family controversies.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In late 2019, her dad had accused her of selling him out to the authorities. She, in turn, accused him, and her brother, Kyle, of threatening her with a sex tape that they had purchased. Todd Chrisley, of course, denied the allegations but went on to accuse his daughter of conducting multiple extramarital affairs. Since that tidbit, nothing much has been heard about the controversy. It may well be that the parties involved have decided to stop airing their dirty linings in public.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Meanwhile, Todd also had a fall out with his eldest son, Kyle, as far back as 2015. As a result, he had to cut Kyle off from the reality TV series following his substance abuse, and they remained estranged for several years. During this period, Kyle accused his father of tax evasion, as well as some other unsavory things. Todd wisely remained mutt in the face of these allegations and his silence has paid off. He and Kyle reconciled in 2019, and he is now helping him battle his demons.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The only Chrisley kids that have stirred clear of controversy so far are Savannah, Chase, and Grayson. Chase and Savannah have even debuted their won spinoff series titled </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Growing Up Chrisley</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>. The series chronicles their road trip from Nashville to Los Angeles as they try to set up base in L.A. and escape their parents’ overbearing influence.&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Growing Up Chrisley</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;debuted in 2018.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=todd-chrisleys-money-troubles-and-his-present-financial-standing></span><strong>Todd Chrisley’s Money Troubles and His Present Financial Standing&nbsp;</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Some people kick off very small and make it big, but then others start very well and end up with almost nothing. Most times, people of the latter category may refuse to see it, living a lavish lifestyle that cannot be sustained. Chrisley’s financial worth will give you a hint of such situations. The real estate guru-turned-reality TV star presently has a net worth put at a negative $five million (-$5 million). Chrisley’s financial troubles started back in 2012 when he recorded a $50 million debt with just $4.2 million of assets in 2012. This dire situation led him to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection that same year. The bankruptcy papers disclosed that he only had $4.2 million in assets, $55 in a bank account, and $100 in cash at the time of filing.</p><p>According to Chrisley’s lawyers, he had to file for bankruptcy because of a single big investment that collapsed. Some market experts, however, disagree and have suggested that it was the 2008 housing market collapse that led to his bankruptcy. Whichever it was, the fact remains that Chrisley filed for bankruptcy and officially came out without a scratch, i.e. a negative net worth, from the entire proceedings. Unofficial records will, however, reveal that the reality TV star continues to live a fabulous life.</p><p>He and his wife continue to vacation at exotic destinations around the world. They also own several houses, including a $3.4 million stately mansion in the Nashville suburb of Brentwood. This confusing situation has led to rumors that Chrisley transferred all his money in his wife’s name during the bankruptcy proceedings and was never as poor as he made the trustees believe. These claims, however, remain unproven and as such Todd Chrisley continues to move on with his life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaGpgZ35uwM6dm2abmKe2tLjEsqpmr5mgtm60yKxknKCZobGzsc1mmKecXaOytXnWqKmtoF8%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f2021-todd-chrisleys-wiki-his-children-and-net-worth.html&text=Todd%20Chrisleys%20Wiki%3a%20His%20Children%20and%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f2021-todd-chrisleys-wiki-his-children-and-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f2021-todd-chrisleys-wiki-his-children-and-net-worth.html&title=Todd%20Chrisleys%20Wiki%3a%20His%20Children%20and%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f2021-todd-chrisleys-wiki-his-children-and-net-worth.html&title=Todd%20Chrisleys%20Wiki%3a%20His%20Children%20and%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f2021-todd-chrisleys-wiki-his-children-and-net-worth.html&title=Todd%20Chrisleys%20Wiki%3a%20His%20Children%20and%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f2021-todd-chrisleys-wiki-his-children-and-net-worth.html&description=Todd%20Chrisleys%20Wiki%3a%20His%20Children%20and%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./instagram-influencer-claims-johnny-depp-slammed-mainstream-media-before-defamation-trial.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Jessica Reed Kraus?
