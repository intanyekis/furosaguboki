In 2003, unhappy with unhealthy or unappetizing snacking choices, and concerned with the increasing number of obesity and diabetes epidemics cases in America, he launched KIND Snacks with the value proposition of being KIND to your body, your taste buds, and your world. KIND has since become the fastest-growing snack company in the United States.</p><p>In 2018, Daniel founded a New York-based family office known as Equilibra, which supports entrepreneur-run businesses that offer packaged goods to consumers, investments include Greek yogurt brand Ellenos as well as social enterprise Yellow Leaf Hammocks. He has featured as a guest shark in episodes of Shark Tank in seasons 11 and 12. When it was reported in November 2020 that Kind North America would be bought by Mars in a deal worth $5 billion Daniel said he would retain his stake in the company and remain involved in its operations.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=daniel-philanthropist></span><span>Daniel Philanthropist</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 2002, Daniel co-founded the OneVoice Movement, an international grassroots effort, to amplify the voices of moderate Israelis and Palestinians seeking to end the conflict, and in 2015 Daniel together with KIND Snacks formed the KIND Foundation. Its signature initiative, Empatico, is a video-conferencing and digital learning platform that connects classrooms around the world designed to help children explore their similarities and differences and expand their world views</p><p>Daniel’s KIND Foundation launched the Frontline Impact Project in conjunction with Project N95 in April 2020. The Project is a platform for healthcare and other frontline responders to ask for resources required in the fight against Covid-19. As of May 14, the Project has linked with more than 40 brands such as Nestle, Unilever, and Mars Incorporated, reaching more than 180,000 people working mostly in nursing homes, hospitals, and outpatient medical practices</p><h1><span>Frequently Asked Questions About Daniel Lubetzky</span></h1><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-daniel-lubetzky></span><span>who is Daniel Lubetzky?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Daniel Lubetzky is a Mexican-American billionaire businessman, author, philanthropist, and founder, and executive chairman of snack company Kind LLC&nbsp; who was born in 1968 in Mexico City, Mexico.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-old-is-daniel-lubetzky></span><span>How Old is Daniel Lubetzky?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Daniel is 53 years old as of now.
