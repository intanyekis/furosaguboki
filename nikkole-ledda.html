The two had walked down the aisle on <strong>July 18, 2020</strong>. Their wedding wasn't extravagant as the entire wedding didn't even cost them <strong>$100</strong>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/3/23/87658836_107647704029332_5953379701659333318_n%20(1)-1679557190078.jpg><p>Ledda tied the knot with her husband in the park where they had first crossed paths.

But, she is no longer a reality TV star and has done a regular job at the car manufacturing company.&nbsp;</p><p>As of now, Ledda also has a YouTube channel to make money but, she has stopped doing regular videos and now makes shorts.

The two are not on good terms and she has even revealed that she hates him.</p><p>Rice came into the picture much later after Ledda's break up with the man that had impregnated her at 15. She took this relationship seriously but this also didn't go as she would have wanted. The two even had a custody battle for their daughter, Ellie who lives with her mother today.</p><h2>Ledda's Boyfriend From 16 And Pregnant Is In Prison</h2><p>Nikkole Ledda's ex-boyfriend, Josh Drummond is currently in jail at the time of this writing.

It happened after she couldn't contact him when he had taken their daughter.&nbsp;</p><p>It was during Christmas when Rice had come to take Ellie. However, she later had no clue where he was as he was not replying to her texts. She had no option but to call the cops at the time.</p><h2>Some Of 16 And Pregnant's Star Controversies</h2><p>Ledda has been the talk of the media for the wrong reasons, a few other times other than for faking a miscarriage.
