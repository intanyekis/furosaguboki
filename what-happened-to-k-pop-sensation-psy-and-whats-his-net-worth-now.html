The song was released by none other than Psy, a popular K-pop artist from South Korea, who wrote and recorded the song as the lead single to his album, 'Psy 6 (Six Rules)', which would soon catapult him to global fame and success.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While 8-years have gone by since the release of the super successful song, there are a number of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">things that people have forgotten about Psy</a>.</p><p>Psy managed to bring K-pop to North America in ways it has never been before, so much so that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Netflix is suddenly shifting their focus to the genre!</a> With the emergence of singers such as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BTS</a>, Blackpink, and 2NE1, many fans of Psy are wondering what happened to the singer and what he has been up to since the release of 'Gangnam Style'. So, what has Psy been up to? Let's find out!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 K-Pop Idols Who Aren’t Originally From Korea</a></span></p><h2 id=psy-where-is-he-now>Psy, Where Is He Now?</h2><p>In 2012, Korean-pop sensation, Psy, released a song that would catapult him to international fame and success. The singer came out with 'Gangnam Style' and it did not take much time before everyone across the globe was singing and dancing to that very song.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The track itself derives from a South Korean neologism that essentially refers to a specific lifestyle associated with the Gangnam District of Seoul, South Korea. This is an area that is known to be incredibly trendy, hip, and full of class, becoming the inspiration behind Psy's hit song.</p><p>While this may have been the first time many people were exposed to K-pop music, it practically opened the door for future artists such as 2NE1, BTS, and Blackpink to become massive in North America, too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After the release of Psy's music video on YouTube, 'Gangnam Style'<strong>, </strong>became the first-ever video on the streaming platform to surpass 1 billion views.<strong> </strong>The video has since amassed nearly 4 billion views since its debut, making it one of the most successful music videos of all time.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Best K-Pop Collaborations With North American Artists</a></span></p><p>The artist has since <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">amassed a net worth of $60 million</a>, making him one of the wealthiest K-pop stars in the industry. According to Business Insider, Psy has managed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">earn a whopping $10 million from YouTube views</a> alone. He has also made millions from endorsements, sales, touring, and of course, his follow up song, 'Gentlemen', which has amassed 1.4 billion views on YouTube.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since his success with 'Gangnam Style', and 'Gentlemen', Psy has gone on to become the founder of his own music label, P Nation, which has most recently signed K-pop sensations, HyunA and E'Dawn.</p><p>While Psy continues to make music of his own, he has found immense success in producing for others on his own label, which is certainly where the big bucks come from! Whether he will release another smash hit in the future remains unknown, however one thing that stands true is that Psy is rich RICH and it's all thanks to 'Gangnam Style'.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>10 K-Pop Artists To Listen To If You Love BTS</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8breMqaapZaOau7St06Kmp2WgqMZurc2dZLCgkanAbrTIrGSnnaRixLC%2B06Fkp6enZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-k-pop-sensation-psy-and-whats-his-net-worth-now.html&text=What%20Happened%20To%20K-Pop%20Sensation%20Psy%2c%20And%20What%27s%20His%20Net%20Worth%20Now%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-to-k-pop-sensation-psy-and-whats-his-net-worth-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-k-pop-sensation-psy-and-whats-his-net-worth-now.html&title=What%20Happened%20To%20K-Pop%20Sensation%20Psy%2c%20And%20What%27s%20His%20Net%20Worth%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-k-pop-sensation-psy-and-whats-his-net-worth-now.html&title=What%20Happened%20To%20K-Pop%20Sensation%20Psy%2c%20And%20What%27s%20His%20Net%20Worth%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-k-pop-sensation-psy-and-whats-his-net-worth-now.html&title=What%20Happened%20To%20K-Pop%20Sensation%20Psy%2c%20And%20What%27s%20His%20Net%20Worth%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-k-pop-sensation-psy-and-whats-his-net-worth-now.html&description=What%20Happened%20To%20K-Pop%20Sensation%20Psy%2c%20And%20What%27s%20His%20Net%20Worth%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./carl-tamayo-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-301262-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Carl Tamayo Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./taylor-swift-pastel-looks-pics-photos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="See Pics Of Her Colored Outfits  Hollywood Life">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
