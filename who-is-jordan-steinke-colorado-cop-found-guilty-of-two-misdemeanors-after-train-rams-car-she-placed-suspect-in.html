On Friday, July 28, Fort Lupton police Officer Jordan Steinke was convicted of reckless endangerment and third-degree assault in connection with the September 2022 crash that left Yareni Rios-Gonzalez seriously injured.</p><p>Judge Timothy Kerns ruled Steinke not guilty of attempted reckless manslaughter, saying there was insufficient evidence to prove that the officer “knowingly intended to harm Ms Rios-Gonzalez." “There’s no reasonable doubt that placing a handcuffed person in the back of a patrol car, parked on railroad tracks, creates a substantial and unjustifiable risk of harm by the train,” Kerns said. When justifying his guilty decision in the misdemeanors, Kerns claimed Steinke did disregard "what she consciously observed," citing the presence of railroad tracks and signs on the highway. Steinke, who had renounced her right to have the case settled by a jury, knelt and sobbed after the verdict was read, according to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">CNN.</a></p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>'He isn't even in charge of his ice-cream order': Trolls hit out at Joe Biden after bizarre statement at factory</a></p><h2 class=split>Who is Jordan Steinke?</h2><p>In September 2022, Steinke was conducting a traffic check during which officials detained Rios-Gonzales, who was accused of brandishing a gun at another car during a road rage case earlier in the evening. The officer handcuffed Rios-Gonzales and placed her into the cruiser of Platteville police officer Pablo Vasque, who arrived first and parked in the middle of a railroad crossing. She was in the car for about two minutes before a freight train rammed the vehicle. The terrifying accident was recorded on police body and dash cameras before the footage was released later by the Platteville Police Department.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>WARNING: GRAPHIC ⚠️ In 2022, a cop in Colorado put a handcuffed woman inside a police cruiser before it was hit by a train.</p><p>Jordan Steinke has been found NOT guilty of attempted reckless manslaughter, and guilty of 2 misdemeanors: 3rd-degree assault and reckless endangerment. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/bjMJxW3oBo</a></p>— Fifty Shades of Whey (@davenewworld_2) <a href=#>July 28, 2023</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>McKinley Hernandez: Colorado babysitter faces felony child abuse charges for causing a 2-year-old boy's massive brain bleed</a></p><p>Rios-Gonzalez survived the crash but sustained severe injuries, including a fractured tibia, broken arm, nine broken ribs and a fractured sternum. During the trial, prosecutors contended that Steinke was aware the police vehicle was positioned next to railway lines but chose to ignore the evident danger. "At the time she elected to place Yareni Rios-Gonzalez in the Platteville patrol car parked on the railroad tracks instead of her patrol unit that was safely parked to the west of the railroad tracks," Weld County Deputy District Attorney Lacy Vells said in court this week, according to ABC<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">.</a> Meanwhile, Steinke argued that she saw the railroad tracks but did not "perceive" the fact that the location was a railroad crossing.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Emmalyn Nguyen case: Outrage after Colorado surgeon Geoffrey Kim gets 15 days jail for teen's death in botched surgery</a></p><h2 class=split>When will Jordan Steinke be sentenced?</h2><p>"I am sure I saw the tracks... but I did not perceive them," Steinke said when pressed by prosecutors. The officer also stated that if she had known the car was parked on railway tracks, she would not have allowed Rios-Gonzalez inside and that she had "trusted" that Vazquez’s vehicle "was in a secure location at that time." Vazquez has also been charged with reckless endangerment along with other charges in connection with the event. For his ongoing case, he is scheduled to make his next court appearance on September 14. Meanwhile, Steinke’s sentencing hearing is scheduled for September 15.</p><p><span><b>More from <i>MEAWW</i></b></span></p><p><a href=#>The hunt for Hanme K Clark: Shooting suspect at large after 3 people killed, 1 injured amid tense standoff in Custer County</a></p><p><a href=#>Lauren Boebert's NSFW theater tryst comes back to bite her as she compares 'pro-Palestine protests' to 'insurrections'</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5ikeqq%2FjKOmq5yRo3q0wMSipaSdXZi8rbvRmpuoZZOkvW6yzq6lnWWXqratwNhmpp9lpKy8brnIrJuepZWWu7C%2B0maYn6yVp3q1vsCipWaqkaLAbq%2FAq2SsoJViva2twp6bZqulqL2mr9NmoKc%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-jordan-steinke-colorado-cop-found-guilty-of-two-misdemeanors-after-train-rams-car-she-placed-suspect-in.html&text=Who%20is%20Jordan%20Steinke%3f%20Colorado%20cop%20found%20guilty%20of%20two%20misdemeanors%20after%20train%20rams%20car%20she%20placed&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-jordan-steinke-colorado-cop-found-guilty-of-two-misdemeanors-after-train-rams-car-she-placed-suspect-in.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-jordan-steinke-colorado-cop-found-guilty-of-two-misdemeanors-after-train-rams-car-she-placed-suspect-in.html&title=Who%20is%20Jordan%20Steinke%3f%20Colorado%20cop%20found%20guilty%20of%20two%20misdemeanors%20after%20train%20rams%20car%20she%20placed" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-jordan-steinke-colorado-cop-found-guilty-of-two-misdemeanors-after-train-rams-car-she-placed-suspect-in.html&title=Who%20is%20Jordan%20Steinke%3f%20Colorado%20cop%20found%20guilty%20of%20two%20misdemeanors%20after%20train%20rams%20car%20she%20placed" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-jordan-steinke-colorado-cop-found-guilty-of-two-misdemeanors-after-train-rams-car-she-placed-suspect-in.html&title=Who%20is%20Jordan%20Steinke%3f%20Colorado%20cop%20found%20guilty%20of%20two%20misdemeanors%20after%20train%20rams%20car%20she%20placed" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-jordan-steinke-colorado-cop-found-guilty-of-two-misdemeanors-after-train-rams-car-she-placed-suspect-in.html&description=Who%20is%20Jordan%20Steinke%3f%20Colorado%20cop%20found%20guilty%20of%20two%20misdemeanors%20after%20train%20rams%20car%20she%20placed" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./abra-cadabra.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Abra Cadabra Height, Weight, Age, Body Statistics">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./spike-lee-parents-birthday-letter-1234862756.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Spike Lee Pens Heartfelt Note To Parents In Celebration Of His Birthday">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
